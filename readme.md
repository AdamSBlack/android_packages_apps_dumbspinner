This is just a dumb spinner used during RetrOS install process.


Fire an intent to change the spinner status, eg:
`am start -n org.retropilot.retros.dumbspinner/org.retropilot.retros.dumbspinner.MainActivity --es "loading_reason" "WHY ARE WE WAITING????"`

scope creeping a bit, not really a serious app - stop gap
